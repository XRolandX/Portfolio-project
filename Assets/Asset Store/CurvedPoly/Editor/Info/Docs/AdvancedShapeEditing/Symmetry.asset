      generate a set of symmetric relationship. If you move a vertex with a symmetric
      relationship, also the vertex with which it is in relationship will be moved.</i> '

    texts:
    - Symmetry defines a set of symmetry relationship between vertices. This relationships
      are built using a <b>Mirroring Plane</b> working as the one used in <b>Mirroring</b>.
      Vertices being ON the plane, are marked with a big yellow spheres. Vertices
      having a symmetric pair vertex across the mirroring plane are connected to their
      counterpart with a straight line in the mirroring direction. Moving one of the
      vertices in the couple, will move the other one as well.
