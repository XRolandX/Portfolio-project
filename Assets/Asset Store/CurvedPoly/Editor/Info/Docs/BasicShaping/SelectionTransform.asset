    - There is a Transform in scene (similar to the one used on every game object)
      you can use to change any group of selected elements. This transform is affected
      by Unity Tools like Move Tool, Rotate Tool or Scale Tool. Here you can control
      its parameters.

    texts:
    - '<i><b>Tip</b>: </i> this transform is based on an <b>Edit Pivot</b> which can
      be edited here. By default, the pivot is positioned at the center of your selection.
      Everytime the set of selected elements is changed, both the pivot and the transform
      are resetted.'

      Pivot. By default its <b>(0,0,0)</b>'

    texts:
    - '<b>Edit Pivot Checkbox</b>: activates the edit pivot mode. in Edit Pivot mode
      the Transform in scene changes the parameters of the Edit Pivot and should not
      affect the selection. The edit pivot reference system can only be translated
      or rotated, not scaled.'
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - '<b>Pivot Position</b>: position of the pivot. This is very important since
      it stays for the position around which <b>Rotation</b> and <b>Scale</b> are
      applied.'
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - '<b>Pivot Rotation</b>: this is a specific tool which rotates the reference
      system of a Pivot, changing the axis directions used when <b>Rotation</b> and
      <b>Scale</b> are applied. For instance, if Pivot Rotation is (0,0,45), a rotation
      of (90,0,0) rotates around the axis (1,1,0) rather than the x-axis (1,0,0)'
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - <i><b>Tip:</b></i> when you change Pivot Rotation, it is not suggested to work
      both on Scale and Rotation. You should rather split the transform in two separated
      steps (first with Scale, second with Rotate) to keep full control of everything.
      To reset the transform between more transform steps, the easiest way is actually
      to unselect everything and select again the same group of elements.
