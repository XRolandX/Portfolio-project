      model. Each hint is used to decide how much segment should be used to approximate
      a curve, and therefore how much triangles are used to tessellate a curved polygon
      into triangles. There are 16 available hints from <b>A</b> to <b>P</b>. '

      used to define the values given to Hints. For instance, it can assign <b>A=3</b>
      and <b>B=5</b> meaning that curves marked with hint <b>A</b> must be approximated
      with 3 segments and curves marker with hint <b>B</b> must be approximated with
      5 segments. Usually, hints are assigned in ascending order, but it is not required.'

      and you need one of this in every Curved Poly Model you want to use. When you
      install Curved Poly Editors, a Default <b> Lods</b> asset is available, one
      which should work fine for every occasion, and it is automatically assigned
      to each model you generate. Such asset contains a default set of Levels of Details
      named <b>Close,Near,Normal,Distant,Far,Box</b>. That said, it''s possible to
      create custom <b>Levels of Detail Assets</b> through menu: <b>Assets->Create->Curved

      a change, make sure you understand how it is affecting other models using the
      same asset. It is not recommended to have to much of this Assets (we trust that
      you shouldn''t have no more than one per scene, or maybe one per device if you
      want LoDs to change according to a device power), but potentially you could
      have a different LoDs Asset for each Curved Poly you put in your scene if you
      think you need it.'
