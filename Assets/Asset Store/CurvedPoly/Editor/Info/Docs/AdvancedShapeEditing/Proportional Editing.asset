      follow the transform, while passive vertices will change their position more
      slowly, at a pace which depends upon their weight. During the transform every

      magenta: gray means that the vertex has a 0% weight assigned and magenta means
      that the vertex as a 100% weight assigned. A Distance function is applied to
      determine such weights with this parameters: '
