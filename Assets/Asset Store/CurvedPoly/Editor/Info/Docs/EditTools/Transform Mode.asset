  title: Transform Mode (Editing Tools)
  paragraphs:
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - Activate a Transform Gizmo on the actual Selection, working in a way which is
      very similar to the way Shape Tools works. The main difference is that this
      editing mode continues working on the same set of elements even in the case
      a selection is changed. On the other side, to exit Transform Mode, you should
      either <b>Apply</b> or <b>Close</b>.  <b>Apply</b> is called automatically,
      as usual, if you select another tool, forcing the exit from this mode.
