    - 'Circleify forces a set of vertices to lay on a circle and than gives you control
      on the circle parameters. This is very useful if you have a closed path of edges
      and you want to make it a perfect circle. It is also useful if you have a circle
      in you model or primitive and you want to shape it without breaking its circular
      shape. Here the parameters you can change:'

    - '<b>Rotation</b>: absolute Rotation with respect to a Default circle laying
      on the XZ plane. This should help you correct the circle orientation when needed.'

  - icons: []
    texts:
    - '<b>Vertical(%)</b>: scaling factor applied on the handles of the vertices of
      the circle. This scaling is applied only on the Vertical direction, that is
      the direction being at 90 degrees (orthogonal) to the circle plane.'
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - '<b>rotation</b>: lateral inclination of the handles of each vertex. This is
      applied with rotational symmetry (so if two vertices are in opposite direction,
      this rotation will happen towards opposite directions.)'
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - The rotation, Vertical and r can be controlled with magenta arrows in the scene
      view. Position and rotation can instead be controlled with Unity transform tools.
      All the parameters can be changed in the menu.
