    - Curved Poly Shape Editor gives you access to a subset of tools and its free.
      Note that the set of tools available with this version of the Editor allows
      you to reshape premade models, but you can't create new models from scratch.
      This make sense if you can access models made with curved poly. There is actually
      a plan to release on Unity Asset Store separated libraries of models made with
      Curved Poly which you can take and reshape with this version of the editor.

    - Curved Poly Shape Editor PRO (Coming Soon)
    mod: 4
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - 'Curved Poly Shape Editor PRO is planned to be released soon, and it''s intended
      to be an intermediate level between Shape Editor and Maker. The idea is that
      you should be able to start with the free Curved Poly Shape Editor (having only
      3 tools set), then you should be able to access more advanced features with
      Shape Editor Pro (a total of 6 toolsets) and then if you have Shape Editor Pro
      you will be able to access all Curved Poly Maker features at a lower price.
      Curved Poly Shape Editor Pro will give you all you need to start playing with  parts
      (and materials), which can''t be edited with the Shape Editor Only. Actually
      we are planning to include into this version of the editor: Composition Tools,
      Materials Tools and Advanced Shape Tools.'
