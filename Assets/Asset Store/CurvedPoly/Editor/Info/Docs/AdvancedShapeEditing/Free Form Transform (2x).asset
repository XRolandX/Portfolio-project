    - 'The Free Form Transform generates a grid of vertices around your selection,
      so that you can reshape the selection by moving the points in the grid. The
      grid will be rendered as a set of lines connecting grid points which can be
      white or blue. You can make white grid points become blue by clicking them.
      You can then use Unity Transform Tool to translate, rotate or scale the subset
      of the blue points, while white points will keep unchanged. In the Menu you
      will find other useful buttons:'
