    - '<i>Tip: if you come from version 1.2, you may have noticed something has been
      simplified on Vertex Snapping. The main reason of this choice is that now Vertex
      Snapping works on every group of selected elements, not only among vertices.
      This required some reworks of the mechanics which, in the end, made us take
      a more simple solution. </i>'
