    - Each edge as a pair of Hints, one on each side. This hints are used to decide
      how much segments should be used to approximate the edge. An hint is a label
      with 16 possible values from <b>A</b> to <b>P</b>, where, usually, <b>A</b>
      means a very low tessellation and low resolution, and <b>P</b> means an extremely
      high one. Good values are usually between <b>C</b> and <b>F</b>, but this pretty
      much depends on the shape of the edge and on what you want to achieve.
