    - 'There are more ways Curved Poly can use to <b>fill</b> a curved polygon with
      a proper set of raw polygons (i.e. triangles). Each way is a specific procedure
      we call <b>Filling Algorithm</b> (or also <b>Interpolation Algorithm</b> or
      <b>Interpolation  Schema</b>). Since they change the way each specific Curved
      Polygon appears, it''s possible to use different <b>Filling Algorithm</b> on
      different curved polygons. You can select any group of Curved Polygons here,
      and click on one of the buttons to try out a different procedure for each curved
      polygon which doesn''t look the way you want it to look. '

    - '<i>Tip: there is a lot of work around Filling Algorithms at MushroomsLabs.
      We literally researching on more and more alternatives to do this. You may find
      new alternative algorithms in newer version of Curved Poly, each one improving
      the way polygons are shaped. Version 1.2 introduced a new algorithm called <b>Half
      Corner Surface</b>, we are planning to introduce a better one we are working
      on in one of the 1.3.x</i>'

      wonderfull polygons in most of the cases. Since version 1.3, it''s the default
      choice for every new model generated with Curved Poly Maker. It''s not perfect,
      but slightly better than <b>Edge Surface Schema</b>, and slightly slower. In
      most of the cases, you should not see a bit difference, but if something looks
      wrong with this schema, you should switch to one of the others.'

      where edges across vertices satisfy some specific constraints (you need to have
      4 edges on a corner, and opposite handles must be aligned; this is the case
      of almost all primitives of Curved Poly - Shape Editor). <i>Cylindric Interpolation
      ignores Edges Editing Normals. </i> Also, this is the reccommended algorithm
      in case you have very little polygons or polygons with a very low Level of Details
      or low Tessellation Hints.'
