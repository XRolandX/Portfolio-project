    - You can decide WHEN Tessellation on Edges must happen. Edges with fixed tessellation
      are tessellated in Edit Mode, and they won't changed when the LoD is changed
      at runtime. Edges with Runtime Tessellation can change LoD at runtime, and they
      are tessellated again each time LoD change.

    - '<i>Tip: at Runtime (Play) Curved Poly re-tessellate the model once for each
      LoD on demand. So, if you don''t change the LoD, the model will be tessellated
      only once. If there are 4 LoDs, the model can be tessellated a maximum of 4
      times, since each mesh is stored in the model and re-used on need. For models
      based on Curved Poly Assets, the meshes are stored in the Asset and are shared
      among all objects using the same Asset.</i>'

      The tessellation amount on that edges will be defined in edit mode. The tessellation
      will be based on the actually chosen LoD. You can change the LoD and press again
      this button to use another LoD on an edge. The name of the LoD will appear in
      scene near the edge (while you are in Tessellation Tools)'
