    - Here yuo can control parameters of an handle. Each handle is accessible both
      from the edge it belongs to (when the editor is using Edges Mode), or from it's
      adjacent vertex (when the editor is using Vertices Mode)

    - '<b>Roll</b>:  in scene, it is shown as an arc-shaped arrow which allows you
      to rotate the handle around the direction of the Editing Normal. Such rotation
      will not affect the normal or the other handles attached to the vertex. The
      arrow is available regardless the normal is visible or not.'

    texts:
    - '<b>Pitch</b>:  in scene, it is shown as an arc-shaped arrow which rotates the
      handle on the plane it share with the Editing Normal. Such rotation will affect
      the normal and the other handles attached to the vertex, they will all rotate
      of the same amount.'

    texts:
    - '<b>Weight</b>:  the weight of the handle, the greater it is the more the edge
      gets near the handle. In scene, drag the little sphere to change the weight
      value assigned to the handle and change the shape of the edge.'

    texts:
    - '<b>Direction</b>: 3D coordinates of the Vector going from the adjacent vertex
      to the handle itself. <i>Important: if the adjacent vertex is marked as ''smooth''
      (most of the times it is for curved shapes) you can''t change the handle direction
      in a way it would move it away from its editing normal plane. This means, for
      instance, that if the Editing Normal (of the adjacent vertex) is (0,1,0), you
      can''t change the y coordinate of the handle Direction, or if it is (1,0,0)
      you can''t change the x coordinate. This is because all the handles Directions
      around the vertex are forced to keep orthogonal (at 90 degrees) from the normal.
