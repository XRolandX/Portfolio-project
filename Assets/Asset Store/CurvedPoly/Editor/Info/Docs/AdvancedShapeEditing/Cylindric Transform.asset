    texts:
    - 'Cylindric Transform is similar to Circleify, but it does not force vertices
      to take some specific shape. It rather generates a cylindric shaped volume around
      selected vertices, and then makes you transform the cylindric volume to reshape
      all that vertices at once. This is a very useful instrument if you want to create
      rotational surfaces from cylindric primitives for instance. Here the parameters
      you can change:'

    texts:
    - '<b>Position</b>: the Position of the center of the cylindric volume.'
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - '<b>Normal</b>: The vertical direction of the cylindric volume, which is by
      default (0,1,0) since this is coherent with the setup of many primitives you
      can generate with Composition Tools. This parameter can only be changed in the
      menu with a manual insertion of values. '

    texts:
    - '<b>radius</b>: radius of the cylinder.'

    texts:
    - '<b>hScale(%)</b>: vertical scale of the cylinder, in the direction of the normal.'
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - '<b>rotation</b>: lateral inclination. This is applied with rotational symmetry,
      and allows you to transform the cylindric volume into a Conic one.'
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - The rotation, hScale and rotation can be controlled with magenta arrows in the
      scene view. The Position can instead be controlled with Unity transform tools.
      All the parameters can be changed in the menu.
