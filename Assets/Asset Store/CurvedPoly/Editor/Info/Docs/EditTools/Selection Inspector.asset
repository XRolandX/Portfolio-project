    - This tool writes a trace of informations about all selected elements. Its quite
      heavy if used on large selections, so you should keep it close when you don't
      need it, and use it on small selection. You can also selectively disable some
      of the infos which are traced to make it a bit less heavy.

    - '<i>Tip: this tool has been thought to give you a very specific inspection instrument,
      which may be useful in situation where edges or polygons overlap in strange
      ways. It''s very detailed and HARD to use. </i>'

    - List of Selected Vertices. Each vertex is presented in the format <b>V[index]</b>,
      where index is the internal index of the vertex assigned by the Editor. Each
      vertex is followed by its coordinates in the format <b>(x,y,z)</b>, to help
      you recognize it.

    - List of Selected Edges (both Curved Edges or Lines). Each vertex is presented
      in the format <b>E[index][V1,V2]</b>, where index is the internal index of the
      edge assigned by the Editor. Each curve or line has two vertices, so V1 is the
      index of its first vertex, V2 is the index of its last vertex.
