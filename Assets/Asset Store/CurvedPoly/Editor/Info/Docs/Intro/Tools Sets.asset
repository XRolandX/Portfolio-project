    - Transform Tools
    - TransformsOperator
    - This tool allows you to switch between different Curved Poly Game Objects and
      change their position (among the ones you have in the scene) and create new
      ones. You can also  access the tools to control how Assets are managed and assigned
      on each Curved Poly.

    - Shape Tools
    - ShapeOperator
    - This tool allows you to shape your models. You can select more elements (vertices,
      curves, polygons, parts, curves handles) and change them. Shape Tools also have
      a section to control backgrounds images or grids which can be used to support
      your modeling processes.

    - Tessellation Tools
    - ShapeTessellationOperator
    - This tools help you define how each curve has to be tessellated into segments
      (and therefore how much each polygon has to be tessellated). The Tools allow
      you to assign <b>hints</b>, where each <b>hint</b> is assigned a different amount
      of segments according to <b>LoD Table</b> which you can customize through <b>LoDs
      Assets</b>

    - Materials Tools
    - MaterialsOperator
    - This tools help you split o model into more parts, where each part can be assigned
      a different material. Each part can also be unwrapped here, in order to generate
      and manipulate UVs. There is the option here to open a UV-Panel to manually
      edit uvs assigned to each element of you model.

    - AdvancedShapeOperator
    - An advanced set of Shaping Tools, which should increase your capabilities of
      keeping control of your shapes. For instamce, find here useful instruments for
      mirroring or keep simmetries among parts of your model.

    - Editing Tools
    - ShapeEditOperator
    - Here you can find a lot of tools to rework the structure of your model.  You
      can cut parts, add cotrol vertices or make curved elements linear or linear
      elements curved.  This is the most complex and complete toolset to generate
      models from scratch.

    - Curves and Surfaces
    - CurvesAndSurfacesOperator
    - Use this to generate custom primitives or shape in a very fast fashion. For
      instance, this is the best and easiest way to geneate Revolution/Rotational
      Surfaces. Shapes generated in this way can be transformed into Curved Poly and
      used in every other tool set.

    - <i>Tip:</i>  if you come from version 1.2, there have been a lot of changes.
      We have completely reworked the way in which tools sets (previously called operators)
      are organized in order to make them more simple to use. Most of the features
      are still present in the Editor, but a different place. Some features have been
      reworked to be a bit more simple to use. If you think this simplificitaion process
      went to far and that you miss something, feel free to contact us explaining
      your position, we will do our best to fit your requirements.
