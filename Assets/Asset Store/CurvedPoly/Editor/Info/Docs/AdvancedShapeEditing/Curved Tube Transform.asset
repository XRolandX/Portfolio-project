      While active, every time you move one of the vertices which were selected in
      first place will affect also vertices which were not part of the first selection.</i>'

    - 'Curved Selection Transform allows you to transform groups of points at once
      in a way that makes transforms on edges between the groups blend smoothly. Before
      you enter the transform you need to plan carefully which vertices you want to
      select:'

    - '<b>Unselected vertices will become passive vertices</b>: each passive vertex
      is assigned to one of the lead vertices, depending upon their distances. (There
      is no other options about this, but we may have more options in the future)'

    texts:
    - Once active,the operation works in a way which is similar to the pointings operator,
      but you will be allowed to point only lead vertices. Once you point a lead vertex,
      all its assigned passive vertices will be selected and also the edges connecting
      vertices in the group will be selected. The entire group will follow any transform
      you apply to the lead vertex.
    mod: 0
  - icons: []
    texts:
    - On each lead vertex you can also find 6 transform handles which will allow you
      to scale or screw the group on its relative x, y or z axis. The handles are
      6 because there are separated scaling factor for down and up, left and right,
      forward and backward.

    - '<i>Tip: This transform always affect all vertices of your model with the exception
      of the ones which have been hidden, so you may want to hide parts of the model
      you don''t want to be affected by these transforms. That said, it is recommended
      to use this transform on fresh Curved Polys with only one shape inside. Indeed,
      you can also mix shapes with Composition Tools at a second time.</i>'
