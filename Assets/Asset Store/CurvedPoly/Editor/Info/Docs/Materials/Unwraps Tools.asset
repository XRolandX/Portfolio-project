    - Unwraps Functions are used to automaticcaly compute UV coordinates for set of
      polygons. Polygons used on unwrap groups must belong to the same part. Each
      Unwrap Functions may be assigned different parameters, which affect the way
      UVs are calculated.

    - '<i><b>Tip: Unwrap Groups</b>. Unwraps Groups are subset of polygons and they
      are generated from a Function. So, for, instance, if you apply of function on
      8 polygons, the funtion may generate 2 separated Groups of 4 polygons each.
      Each separated Unwrap Group can furtherly be edited by accessing the UV Panel.

    - '<b>About v 1.3.1</b>: with this release, we have simplified the way in which
      Unwrap Functions work. Now the Unwrap is applied directly on all the polygons
      of Active Part and does not require a specific selection of polygons. Furthermore,
      there are more options (see Unwrap Options in the dedicated inspector) to define
      how the model is split into Unwrap Groups before a specific function is applied.'
