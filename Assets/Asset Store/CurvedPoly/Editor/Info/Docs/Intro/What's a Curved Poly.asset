    texts:
    - Curved Poly is a Models Editor which uses curves to shape complex curved polygons
      which are then tessellated into meshes. Each Curved Poly Model can be tessellated
      into more meshes, with more or less real polygons, each one representing a different
      <b>Level of Detail</b> of the model.

    - 'There are more ways to assign a model. <b>Curved Poly Assets</b> are assets
      which contain Curved Poly Shapes. You can directly assign an Asset to a Curved
      Poly Component: all Game Objects accessing the same Curved Poly Asset will share
      the same shape.  <b>Or</b>, using Curved Poly Editor, you can import an Asset
      into a Curved Poly component. <i>Models imported into Curved Poly Components
      not having an asset assigned will be stored in scene</i>. '

    - With Curved Poly Editor any model can be easily Reshaped into something different.
      There are a lot of different objects which can be shaped out of the most simple
      shapes and primitives!

    texts:
    - A Curved Poly must use a <b>LoD Asset</b> to decide how meshes shall be generated.
      <b>LoD Assets</b> containts <b>hints</b> which are used to define how much segments
      are used to tessellate curves, and therefore how much triangles are used to
      tessellate curved polygons. Each <b>LoD Asset</b> contains more possibile <b>LoDs</b>,
      which can be switched both in Play Mode and Edit mode. There is a  <b>Default
      LoDs</b> Asset which is assigned by default, but you can always generate a custom
      one.

    - Each Curved Poly Shape is made of more parts. You can assign each part with
      a different material. When you Add/Import a <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> into a
      <b>Curved Poly Component</b>, the model will be assigned first with a default
      material which is mean to be used only for editing purposes and which you should
      change.
