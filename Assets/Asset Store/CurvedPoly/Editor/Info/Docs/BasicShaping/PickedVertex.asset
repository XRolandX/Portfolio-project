    - <b>Normal:</b> the Editing Normal of a vertex. This normals is not only the
      normal the vertex will be assigned on the generated mesh. It is used to control
      the Direction of all the handles around the vertex (only when that vertex is
      smooth). It is also used in the construction of polygons (in both the Composition
      Tools or the Edit Tools)

      Sharp vertices are visually marked with an empty square, instead of a cube,
      to distinguish them from smooth vertices.</i>'
